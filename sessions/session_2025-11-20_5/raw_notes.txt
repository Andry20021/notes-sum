Here are the detailed network notes:
1. OSI Model:
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a 7-layered framework that provides a structured approach to designing and implementing computer networks.
Each layer of the OSI model focuses on a specific function, from physical connections to high-level protocols.
Physical Layer (Layer 1): + Defines the physical means of data transmission + Cables, switches, routers
Data Link Layer (Layer 2): + Ensures error-free transfer of data frames between two devices on the same network + MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, frames, Ethernet
Network Layer (Layer 3): + Routes data between networks + IP (Internet Protocol) addressing, routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, BGP
Transport Layer (Layer 4): + Provides reliable data transfer between devices on the same network or over a distance + TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Session Layer (Layer 5): + Establishes and manages connections between applications running on different devices + Presentation layer encryption, formatting
Presentation Layer (Layer 6): + Converts data into a format that can be understood by the receiving device + Application-layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
Application Layer (Layer 7): + Provides services to end-user applications + Protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SFTP
2. TCP/IP Model:
The TCP/IP model is a 4-layered framework that provides a structured approach to designing and implementing computer networks.
Each layer of the TCP/IP model focuses on a specific function, from physical connections to high-level protocols.
Link Layer (Layer 1): + Ensures efficient transmission of data between devices connected through a cable or switch + Link Layer protocols like ARP, RARP
Internet Layer (Layer 2): + Routes traffic between networks and provides addressing information + Network Layer protocols like RIP, OSPF, BGP
Transport Layer (Layer 3): + Provides reliable data transfer between devices on the same network or over a distance + Transport Layer protocols like TCP, UDP
Application Layer (Layer 4): + Provides services to end-user applications + Application-layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
3. IP Addressing:
Internet Protocol (IP) is used to address devices on the internet
There are two types of IP addresses:
IPv4: 32-bit, dotted decimal, 4 octets
IPv6: 128-bit, hex
Subnetting: + Divides a network into smaller segments or sub-networks + CIDR (Common Internet Protocol Request Data Registration) notation is used to specify subnet masks
4. Routing:
Static routing and dynamic routing are two common methods used to route packets between networks.
Routers forward packets based on IP addresses, using routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, BGP.
Routing Protocols: + RIP (Remote Internet Protocol) + OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) + BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
5. Switching:
Switches work at the Data Link layer
MAC (Media Access Control) addresses are used to forward packets within a network
MAC Address Table: + A table that stores information about all devices connected to a switch
VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks): + Segregated networks, each with its own set of devices and protocols + Used for segmentation in large-scale networks
6. TCP vs UDP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transfer between devices.
Reliable delivery, error-checking, flow control, and congestion control
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that provides fast, but unreliable data transfer.
No guarantee of delivery, no error-checking
7. Common Protocols:
HTTP/HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol over HTTPS
Secure web browsing using TLS encryption
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over the network
Reliable file transfer between devices
SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol): Secure file transfer over the network
Secure file transfer between devices, especially in secure environments
DNS (Domain Name System): Domain name to IP addressing
Maps domain names to IP addresses for ease of use and access
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Dynamic assignment of IP addresses to devices on a network
Automatically assigns IP addresses based on device capabilities
8. Network Devices:
Hub: Simple, broadcasts data between connected devices
Switch: MAC-based forwarding, uses switches as the backbone of a network
Router: IP-based forwarding, used to route traffic between networks
Firewall: Packet filtering, used to protect a network from unauthorized access or malicious activity
9. Wireless Networking:
Wi-Fi standards:
802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax: Various wireless communication protocols and standards
SSID (Service Set Identifier): A unique identifier for a wireless network
Encryption methods:
WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3: Various encryption protocols used in Wi-Fi networks
Channels and interference:
Various channels, such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
Interference from nearby devices or physical obstacles
10. Network Troubleshooting:
Ping (Ping of Light):
Verifies network connectivity by sending a packet to the destination device
Traceroute:
Displays the path packets take through the network, helping identify bottlenecks
NSlookup:
Uses DNS queries to resolve domain names to IP addresses
IPconfig/Ifconfig:
Configures and displays network settings, such as Ethernet adapters
