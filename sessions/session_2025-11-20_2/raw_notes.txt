Networking Notes - Test

1. OSI Model:
   - 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
   - Physical: cables, switches
   - Data Link: MAC addresses, frames, Ethernet
   - Network: IP addressing, routing
   - Transport: TCP/UDP, port numbers, flow control
   - Session: session management
   - Presentation: encryption, formatting
   - Application: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS

2. TCP/IP Model:
   - 4 layers: Link, Internet, Transport, Application
   - Link = OSI Physical + Data Link
   - Internet = OSI Network
   - Transport = OSI Transport
   - Application = OSI Session + Presentation + Application

3. IP Addressing:
   - IPv4: 32-bit, dotted decimal, 4 octets
   - IPv6: 128-bit, hex
   - Subnetting: dividing networks
   - CIDR notation: e.g., /24

4. Routing:
   - Static vs dynamic routing
   - Routers forward packets based on IP
   - Routing protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP

5. Switching:
   - Switches work at Data Link layer
   - MAC address table
   - VLANs for segmentation

6. TCP vs UDP:
   - TCP: connection-oriented, reliable, flow control, error-checking
   - UDP: connectionless, fast, no guaranteed delivery

7. Common Protocols:
   - HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SFTP
   - DNS: domain name to IP
   - DHCP: assigns IP addresses dynamically
   - SNMP: network management

8. Network Devices:
   - Hub: simple, broadcasts
   - Switch: MAC-based forwarding
   - Router: IP-based forwarding
   - Firewall: packet filtering

9. Wireless Networking:
   - Wi-Fi standards: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax
   - SSID, encryption (WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3)
   - Channels and interference

10. Network Troubleshooting:
    - ping, traceroute, nslookup, ipconfig/ifconfig
    - Check connectivity, latency, packet loss
